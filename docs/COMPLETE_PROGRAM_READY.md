## 📊 How It Works

### 1. Program Generation
```
User inputs → Backend generates:
  - 8 weeks of dice rolls (2d6 per week)
  - NL (total reps) for each lift at each intensity
  - Day-by-day breakdown based on template
  - Rep ladders based on individual RMs
  - Suggested sets for each session
```

### 2. Day-by-Day View
Each session shows:
- **Lift name** (e.g., "Upper Body Press")
- **Intensity** (Heavy/Medium/Light)
- **Total reps** to complete
- **Your RM** for reference
- **Tip:** Break into sets using your rep ladder

### 3. Rep Ladders (Your Original Logic)
Based on RM:
- RM 4: [1, 2, 3]
- RM 5: [2, 3, 3]
- RM 6: [2, 3, 4]
- RM 7: [2, 4, 5]
- RM 8: [3, 4, 5]
- RM 9: [3, 5, 6]
- RM 10: [3, 5, 7]
- RM 11: [4, 6, 7]
- RM 12: [4, 6, 8]
- RM 13: [4, 7, 9]
- RM 14: [5, 7, 9]
- RM 15: [5, 8, 10]

## 🎓 How to Use Your Program

### For Athletes:

1. **Create your program** with your current RMs
2. **View Week 1, Session A**
3. **For each lift:**
   - See the total reps (e.g., 11 reps)
   - Use your rep ladder (e.g., [3, 5, 7] for RM 10)
   - Do sets until you hit the total: 3+5+3 = 11 ✓
4. **Complete all sessions** for the week
5. **Move to Week 2** and repeat

### For Coaches:

1. **Create programs** for your athletes
2. **Share the program** (copy link or export PDF - coming soon)
3. **Monitor progress** (tracking features - Phase 2)

## 🐛 Known Limitations (To Address)

1. **No automatic rep breakdown** - Athletes must calculate sets themselves
   - *Solution:* Add "Auto-calculate sets" button (easy to add)

2. **No PDF export yet** - Can't print programs
   - *Solution:* Add PDF generation endpoint (planned)

3. **No program list** - Can't see all created programs
   - *Solution:* Add programs list page (planned)

4. **No athlete assignment** - Coaches can't assign to specific athletes
   - *Solution:* Add athlete management (Phase 2)
