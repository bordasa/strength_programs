   - All tables created (users, athletes, programs, program_configs, program_weeks)
   - ✅ Ready to store data

2. **FastAPI Backend**
   - Running on `http://localhost:8000`
   - ✅ API is healthy and responding
   - ✅ Database connected
   - ✅ All endpoints ready

3. **React Frontend**
   - Running on `http://localhost:5173`
   - ✅ Hot reload enabled
   - ✅ Connected to backend

## 🌐 Access Your Application

### Frontend (Main App)
**URL:** http://localhost:5173

Open this in your browser to see your React app!

### Backend API Documentation
**URL:** http://localhost:8000/docs

This is an **interactive API playground** where you can:
- See all available endpoints
- Test API calls directly in the browser
- View request/response formats

### API Health Check
**URL:** http://localhost:8000/health

Returns: `{"status":"healthy"}`

## 🧪 Test the Battleship Program

Let's verify your Battleship logic works! Open http://localhost:8000/docs and try this:

1. Click on **POST /api/programs**
2. Click "Try it out"
3. Paste this JSON:

```json
{
  "athlete_id": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
  "created_by": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
  "num_lifts": 4,
  "lift_rms": {
    "upper_body_press": 10,
    "upper_body_pull": 12,
    "hip_hinge": 8,
    "squat": 9
  }
}
```

4. Click "Execute"

You'll get back a complete 8-week Battleship program with:
- Dice rolls for each week
- NL values for H/M/L intensities
- All stored in the database!

## 📊 What We Fixed

During setup, we encountered and fixed:

1. ❌ Network timeout downloading Docker images
   - ✅ **Fixed:** Pulled images separately

2. ❌ Obsolete `version` in docker-compose.yml
   - ✅ **Fixed:** Removed deprecated version field

3. ❌ Invalid `python-cors` package in requirements.txt
   - ✅ **Fixed:** Removed (FastAPI has built-in CORS)

4. ❌ No database tables
   - ✅ **Fixed:** Created and applied Alembic migration

## 🎯 What's Next?

Now that everything is running, you can start building features! Here are your options:

### Option A: Build Authentication UI (Recommended First)
Create login and registration pages so users can create accounts.

**Files to create:**
- `frontend/src/pages/LoginPage.tsx`
- `frontend/src/pages/RegisterPage.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/auth/LoginForm.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/auth/RegisterForm.tsx`

### Option B: Build Program Creation Form
Create the interface for generating Battleship programs.

**Files to create:**
- `frontend/src/pages/CreateProgramPage.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/programs/ProgramForm.tsx`

### Option C: Test the API First
Before building UI, test all the API endpoints:

1. Go to http://localhost:8000/docs
2. Try registering a user
3. Try logging in
4. Try creating a program

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

### Making Changes

**Backend Changes:**
1. Edit files in `backend/app/`
2. FastAPI auto-reloads (watch the logs)
3. Test at http://localhost:8000/docs

**Frontend Changes:**
1. Edit files in `frontend/src/`
2. Vite hot-reloads automatically
3. See changes at http://localhost:5173

**Database Changes:**
1. Edit models in `backend/app/models/`
2. Create migration: `docker exec strength_programs_backend alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description"`
3. Apply: `docker exec strength_programs_backend alembic upgrade head`

### Viewing Logs

```bash
# All services
docker-compose logs -f

# Just backend
docker-compose logs -f backend

# Just frontend
docker-compose logs -f frontend

# Just database
docker-compose logs -f db
```

### Stopping the Application

```bash
# Stop all containers (keeps data)
docker-compose down

# Stop and remove all data
docker-compose down -v
```

### Starting Again

```bash
# Start (if already built)
docker-compose up

# Rebuild and start (after code changes)
docker-compose up --build
```

## 📚 Understanding the Two-Step Process

You asked about why we need two commands. Here's the explanation:

### Step 1: `docker-compose up --build`
**What it does:**
- Builds Docker images from your code
- Starts PostgreSQL (empty database)
- Starts FastAPI backend
- Starts React frontend

**What it DOESN'T do:**
- Create database tables

### Step 2: `alembic upgrade head`
**What it does:**
- Reads your SQLAlchemy models
- Creates SQL commands to build tables
- Executes those commands in PostgreSQL

**Why separate?**
- The database must be running BEFORE you can create tables
- You only run this once (or when schema changes)
- This is like "git for your database" - tracks changes over time

**Analogy:**
- Step 1 = Building and opening a restaurant
- Step 2 = Installing the tables and chairs inside

## 🎓 Key Concepts Explained

### What is Docker Compose?
Orchestrates multiple containers (database, backend, frontend) so they work together.

### What is Alembic?
Version control for your database schema. Like git, but for database structure.

### What is FastAPI?
Your backend framework - handles API requests, talks to database, runs business logic.

### What is React?
Your frontend framework - what users see and interact with in the browser.

### What is PostgreSQL?
Your database - stores all data (users, programs, workouts).

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Containers won't start
```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose up --build
```

### Port already in use
```bash
# Find what's using the port
lsof -i :8000  # Backend
lsof -i :5173  # Frontend
lsof -i :5432  # Database

# Kill it or change ports in docker-compose.yml
```

### Database connection errors
```bash
# Restart database
docker-compose restart db

# Check if it's healthy
docker-compose ps
```

### Frontend not loading
```bash
# Check logs
docker-compose logs frontend

# Rebuild
docker-compose up --build frontend
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Keep docker-compose running** - Leave it in a terminal window
2. **Use the API docs** - http://localhost:8000/docs is your best friend
3. **Check logs often** - `docker-compose logs -f` shows everything
4. **Commit your work** - Use git to save progress
5. **Read the build plan** - `docs/build-plan.md` has the full roadmap
